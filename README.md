## Setup Guidelines

### Step 1: Creating Virtual Environment

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the repository
cd AgentFramework

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Files

1. **Create Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Copy the template
   cp README.env .env
   ```

2. **Configure Azure Settings**
   - Edit the `.env` file with your Azure configuration.
   - See [Environment Setup Guide](https://github.com/rajeevsingh-msft/agent-framework-journey/blob/main/README.env) for detailed instructions.

3. **Verify Azure Authentication**
   ```bash
   az login
   az account show  # Verify correct subscription
   ```

### Step 4: Azure AI Foundry Project Setup

Follow the detailed setup instructions in our [Setup Guide](https://github.com/rajeevsingh-msft/agent-framework-journey/blob/main/documents/Microsoft%20Foundry-setup-guide.md) to:

- Create an Azure AI Foundry project
- Configure model deployments
- Get your project endpoint
- Set up authentication

## Quickstart

### Agents

1. **Navigate to the Agents directory:**
   ```bash
   cd python/1.Agents/1.ai-foundry-agents
   ```

2. **Run the first agent demo:**
   ```bash
   python demo1-AIFoundryAgents.py
   ```

Here's an example of how to create and run a simple agent:

```python
import asyncio
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from agent_framework import Agent  # GA API: Using Agent class
from agent_framework.foundry import FoundryChatClient  # Enhanced client
from azure.identity.aio import AzureCliCredential

load_dotenv()

async def main():
    try:
        async with (
            AzureCliCredential() as credential,
            Agent(
                client=FoundryChatClient(
                    model=os.getenv("FOUNDRY_MODEL", "gpt-4o"),
                    credential=credential
                ),  # GA API: 'client' parameter with model
                instructions="You are good at telling jokes.",
                name="JokeAgent"  # GA feature: named agents
            ) as agent,
        ):
            result = await agent.run("Tell me a joke about a pirate.")
            print(f"Agent: {result.text}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Expected Output:

```
Why don't pirates ever get lost? Because they always have their "sea" legs!
```

### Workflow

1. **Navigate to the Sequential Workflow directory:**
   ```bash
   cd python/2.Workflow/1.Getting-started/1.Sequential-workflow
   ```

2. **Run the first workflow demo:**
   ```bash
   python 1.create-sequential-workflow.py
   ```

Here's the actual sequential workflow from our repository:

```python
import asyncio
from typing_extensions import Never
from agent_framework import WorkflowBuilder, WorkflowContext, WorkflowOutputEvent, Executor, executor, handler

# Custom Executor class
class UpperCase(Executor):
    def __init__(self, id: str):
        super().__init__(id=id)

    @handler
    async def to_upper_case(self, text: str, ctx: WorkflowContext[str]) -> None:
        result = text.upper()
        await ctx.send_message(result)

# Function-based executor
@executor(id="reverse_text_executor")
async def reverse_text(text: str, ctx: WorkflowContext[Never, str]) -> None:
    result = text[::-1]
    await ctx.yield_output(result)

async def main():
    upper_case = UpperCase(id="upper_case_executor")
    
    # Build the workflow
    workflow = (
        WorkflowBuilder()
        .add_edge(upper_case, reverse_text)
        .set_start_executor(upper_case)
        .build()
    )
    
    # Run the workflow
    async for event in workflow.run_stream("hello world"):
        if isinstance(event, WorkflowOutputEvent):
            print(f"Workflow completed with result: {event.data}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Expected Output:

```
Workflow completed with result: DLROW OLLEH
```
